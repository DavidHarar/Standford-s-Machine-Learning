This repository includes my solutions for the great introductionary course [Stardford's Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-course/home/week/2)
by Andrew Ng. In the previous version of this course, the excercises were written for Matlab/Octave, so I translated them 
into R (including the functions that are given by the instructors), and solve them.  
Any mistake in the code is mine.
